# httppubsubprotocol

## PROJECT STAGE - PLANNING

This project is in the development stage 1 - planning. This means that most things
you see won't work yet and are in the process of being finalized. Star/watch this
repository to be notified when it reaches the next stage!

## Overview

This is the Python specification for the protocol used by the canonical implementation
[httppubsubserver](https://github.com/Tjstretchalot/httppubsubserver). It serves both
as a reference for the protocol and as a helper library for the Python server and client.

The types here are intended to facilitate alternate server and client
implementations in a variety of languages, such as Ruby, TypeScript, and Rust.
